# Agile best practices

Working as a Software Quality Engineer I've worked in many different teams setup in different levels
of maturity. Thinking about QA process and agile software development I created this repository to document
some of the best practices that I could see value adopting or suggesting from a quality stand point and worked.

The items described in this repo is based in **my** experience and observations, feel free to try it out on your team,
it will be updated over time.

The focus here is to bring quality early in the SDLC adopting [shift left testing](https://medium.com/@qavengers/shift-left-testing-62e03d809cc3)

If you have any questions about it, you can [reach out to me directly](mailto:tiago.goes2009@gmail.com) or open an issue describing better your context
and I can help you :)
