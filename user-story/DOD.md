# Definition of Done Best Practices based on Tiago's experience

In order to consiser something **Done** as a team we need make sure we all have the same understanding about what "Done" means.
Usually, dev teams are used to work and move cards from `backlog -> in progress -> ready to test` flow and end up missing or not having the
ownership about the user story from conception through production, however, this is a serious pitfall in my point of view, everyone must be
responsible for the product quality (development and testing) and delivery.

- Acceptance criteria fulfilled
- Code review completed
- Suficient test coverage added (unit, integration and e2e based on what was defined previously)
- All tests passing (brand new + regression)
- Exploratory testing on stagging/homolog environment done
- Review with stakeholders done (including internal communication like: customer service team)
- Documentation updated
- Deployment in production environment completed (Including any extra step needed defined previously)
- Technical Product metrics not affected negatively (performance, error rates, customer tickets)
